# Docker from Scratch Workshop - Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey through the **Docker from Scratch** workshop, where I’ve worked on various levels to build a containerization system step-by-step. It includes code, explanations, and additional resources for each level.

## Main Repository

For detailed documentation and the original source of this workshop, please refer to the official repository:  
[Rubber-Docker GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Fewbytes/rubber-docker/tree/master/docs) — **Highly Recommended** to go through this before proceeding.

## Repository Overview

### Completed Levels

I have successfully completed the following levels, each with its own folder containing code and a brief explanation of my understanding. I’ve also included comments and notes to help others follow along. I will update this list as I complete more levels.

- **Level 1**: Filesystem Isolation using `chroot`
- **Level 2**: Adding Basic Namespaces
- **Level 3**: Switching to `pivot_root` and `unmounting`

Each level’s folder contains:
- Code implementation
- A brief explanation in its `README.md`
- My comments and insights based on working through the code

### Known Issues

If you encounter any problems while working through this repository, please refer to the `issues/known_issues.md` file. This file logs all issues I’ve faced, along with potential fixes and workarounds.

### Ubuntu Image

I’ve also included the `ubuntu.tar` image in the `ubuntu-image/` directory. You can directly use this image for your container by following the instructions from the workshop without having to download it separately.

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Clone** the repository.
2. Navigate to the **level folders** to find the code and explanation for each level.
3. **Refer to known_issues.md** if you face issues during execution.
4. Use the **provided `ubuntu.tar` image** for quick setup.
